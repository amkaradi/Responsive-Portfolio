                <p>HEY Y'ALL! A little about my journey: After graduating from The University of Wisconsin. I booked a one-way ticket to the Brussels to work for the Le Châtelain Boutique Hôtel as an Event Coordinator and ended doing a little Euro-tripping on the weekends. After concludeding, I took up a position in Barcelona working for a Japanese company, Kyocera. Living in a tiny flat near Las Ramblas I developed a keen love for the architecture and the narrow winding streets; and above all, a fondness for CHURROS! Aside from my time spent in the EU, I have been to Panama where I learned to zip line through the forest canopies and drive SUVs through the jungle. It is also where I had the extraordinary opportunity to work for the United Nations of Department of Safety and Security. Back here in Chicago, I am now looking for a place to initiate my career in an area that can create meaningful change.</p>
                <p>Like many of my fellow class mates; I am now juggling work and studies. Currenlty I work at a French consulting company, Capgemini, while I take classes to become a FULL-STACK DVELOPER!!!</p>
